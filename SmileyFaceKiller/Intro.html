    <p>The smiley face killer theory all began with the 1997 death of 21-year-old Patrick McNeill. McNeill was last seen drinking with friends in a Manhattan bar. Volunteers plastered the city with thousands of “Missing” fliers. McNeill’s body was found two months later and 12 miles away, near the entrance to New York Harbor. </p>
    <p>Since 1997 over 40 college aged mens bodies have been found in waterways all over the United States. A lot of the deaths happened after a night of partying in bars and police are sure drugs and alcohol were involved as well. Since most of the bodies were relatively untouched they were either ruled accidental deaths or suicides.
        The police do not believe there is any foul play involved even with the similar manner in which these men went missing and died.
